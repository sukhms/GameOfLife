# GameOfLife
The Game of Life was created by British mathematician John Horton Conway. Each cell is either dead or alive. The user will be asked to input an integer to determine how many generations the program will run the game for. The program starts off with specific cells that are alive and during each generation, the cell is assessed on whether it will be alive or dead in the next generation, based on the following rules:   

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbor dies, as if by underpopulation.     
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbor lives on to the next generation.     
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbor dies, as if by overpopulation     
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.  

Enjoy!
